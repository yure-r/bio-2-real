# Lparser example file

# This file is to show the starting orientation of the turtle
# and the basic directions. The colors are as they will appear in
# the lviewer. This file will generate three blocks. Red is the current 
# forward direction, yellow is the current left direction and green
# is the current up direction.
#
# By replacing rule 2 with the one of the following alternatives 
# you can get a better grip on the turtle movement through space :
#
# T = ^f			# pitch up and go forward
# T = &f			# pitch down and go forward
# T = +f			# turn left and go forward
# T = -f			# turn right and go forward
# T = >f			# roll right (= clockwise) and go forward
# T = <f			# roll left (= counter clockwise) and go forward
#
# Run these alternatives at a recursion level of 50.
#
# T = ^+>f			# cylindrical motion
# T = +;'fff			# spiral motion
# T = +:f			# 'inverse' spiral motion
